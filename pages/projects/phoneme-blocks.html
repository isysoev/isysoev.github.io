                        English is notorious for its convoluted relationship between units of its spelling (letters) and its pronunciation (<a class="inline-href" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme">phonemes</a>). For instance, letter A can represent at least six different phonemes: [ɑ] as in f<u><b>a</b></u>ther, [æ] as in c<u><b>a</b></u>t, [eɪ] as in n<u><b>a</b></u>me, [ʌ] as in dat<u><b>a</b></u>, [ɛ] as in c<u><b>a</b></u>re, [ɔ] as in <u><b>a</b></u>lso. Conversely, there are at least four ways to represent phoneme [ʌ]: U as in tr<u><b>u</b></u>ck, O as in c<u><b>o</b></u>me, A as in dat<u><b>a</b></u>, and TE as in lis<u><b>te</b></u>n. This complexity obscures the phonological structure of the language, the mastery of which is crucial for early literacy learning. In addition, in a <a class="inline-href" href="child-driven-machine-guided.html">child-driven literacy app</a>, this makes it difficult for children to spell words sound-by-sound.

                        In this project, we experimented with using phonemes, instead of letters, as building blocks for making words.

                         We developed a set of animated characters, called "sound creatures", that represent various sounds of English language. They do so through onomatopoeia (sound mimicry), producing their respective sounds through some action. I designed almost all of the characters and animated about a third of them.

                        These characters can operate within two types of blocks. Letter blocks have constant spelling, but their sound changes in different words. Phoneme blocks act the other way around: their sound is constant, but their spelling changes depending on the context. You can see the difference between the two in the video below.

                        Evaluation of the blocks was part of a study examining <a class="inline-href" href="child-driven-machine-guided.html">child-driven, machine-guided</a> approach to early literacy learning. It occurred at a public charter school in Boston area. 25 children, 4-5 years old, used SpeechBlocks in their class throughout the semester. The reader can find more details about this study and its findings in our <a class="inline-href" href="assets/publications/Sysoev-et-al-IJCCI-Published-Manuscript.pdf">IJCCI paper</a> listed below.

                    <h3 class="section-heading text-uppercase">Reaction to sound creatures</h3>
                    <p>
                        Children responded to the sound creatures with interest and attention. Some of the reactions were: (1) exclamations of amusement and delight, such as <i>“This is hilarious!”</i> and <i>“Mamma mia!”</i>; (2) motor responses, such as jumping in their seats in pretend horror when seeing an animation of the snake creature; (3) mimicking the sounds produced by the creatures; and (4) commenting on the character’s actions, such as responding <i>“Ouch! His finger is bleeding!”</i> to the animation of the [oʊ] creature (who touched a cactus and exclaimed <i>“Ow!”</i>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsequent interview with the children showed that most of them understood the key principles behind the creatures: that the same creature can have different forms, corresponding to different graphemes; that each of these forms produces the same sound; and that their forms represent letters. They did not, however, remembered the names that we gave to the creatures.

                        In some cases, superficial details of the creatures’ appearance obscured their link to phonemes. For instance, a few children responded to karate-kicking animation for the [k] creature with sounds <i>“Hiya!”</i> and <i>“Pfff!”</i>. A child building ELSA from the cartoon Frozen could not believe that Elsa starts with [ɛ], saying: <i>“It is so ugly; how can it be in her name?”</i> ([ɛ] it was represented by an elderly person who struggled to hear and exclaimed <i>“Eh?”</i>)

                        To check whether sound creatures served as useful mnemonics for phonemes, at the end of the study we administered a minigame. We asked children to find what makes certain sounds on two keyboards: one with letters, and another - with sound creatures. We measured both accuracy and speed of finding sounds.

                        An initial analysis showed no difference between the conditions, but observationally we noticed that some children did a lot better with sound creatures, and others - with letters. We applied a Bayesian mixed-effects model to see if this was something beyond mere chance. It turned out that this was indeed the case, and we can expect a fraction of children to benefit from the sound creatures, while for others they are not useful (see our paper for details). Unfortunately, we were unable to pinpoint what may cause this difference. Our speculation is that it might have been caused by different levels of familiarity with letters and letter sounds: those who knew them well found the creatures redundant.
