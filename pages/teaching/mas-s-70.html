                        This special topics class was organized by research scientist <a class="inline-href" href="http://jimgray.net/">Jim Gray</a> and my advisor <a class="inline-href" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/dkroy/overview/">Dr. Deb Roy</a>. It was focused on learning in informal environments and contexts: intrinsically motivated, grounded, socially connected. At the time, I was spearheading a line of research that was closely aligned with these topics within my lab. Because of this, Jim and Deb encouraged me to be deeply involved in organizing this class, including planning of the structure and the curriculum, selecting topics and speakers. You can find our class materials and syllabus <a class="inline-href" href="https://www.learningintheflow.org/">here</a>.

                        We strived to maintain students' intrinsic motivation throughout the class. Towards this end, I advocated that the class should be pass/fail, as research shows that grading pressures tend to inhibit intrinsic motivation. We also had a Slack channel where students could ask questions related to their personal areas of interest. I was responsible for answering these questions, and in process of doing that, I tried to build a network of connections between different topics and students individual experiences.

                        Our class was partially speaker-based, partially project-based. To facilitate conversation with the speakers, we asked students to prepare questions in advance. One of my roles was to curate these questions (e.g. cluster them into themes). During the class discussions, I occasionally answered the students' questions, drawing examples from my own experience. If students requested advice on their projects, I met with them individually to discuss their work.
