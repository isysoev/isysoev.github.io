                        This special topics class was organized by my colleague <a class="inline-href" href="https://safinahali.com/">Safinah Ali</a> and I, under the supervision of our mentor <a class="inline-href" href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/cynthiab/overview/">Dr. Cynthia Breazeal</a>. We came up with the idea of this class, since during our own journeys of developing technology for children, we realized that it involves a great amount of perspectives from many different fields, and these perspectives are sometimes at odds with each other. Figuring out these contradictions was once very confusing for us, and we wanted to create a class that would spare others the same confusion.

                    <p>
                        In our class, we combined materials from the fields of learning theory, constructionist learning, design, game design and educational technology practice. You can find our class materials and syllabus <a class="inline-href" href="https://s65spring.github.io/">here</a>.

                        Our class is partially reading-based, partially project-based. Correspondingly, it is composed of two types of sessions: theoretical ones and design studios.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Theoretical sessions are focused on discussion of the readings from the relevant fields. We wanted to avoid students merely recapping the papers; instead, we wanted them to build mental connections between different materials and their own experience. In search for a medium that would best facilitate that, I recalled making "mind maps" for my PhD exams. That time, I was facing with the problem of forgetting most of what I've read after a year or so, which seemed like a big waste. To avoid this, I started to draw diagrams where I represented the relationships between the key ideas of the reading and added little drawings that I called "mental anchors", which would help me to recall what each part was about. This technique turned out to be very effective: many years later, I still can easily recall the key ideas of each reading. I proposed to use the same idea in the class, and it was enthusiastically accepted by the students. The picture below (tap to enlarge) shows two "mind maps": on the left, my original creation; on the right, a "mind map" from the class. The student included visuals, made connection to other readings, and mentioned examples from her own lived experience. In the survey that we recently conducted, several students listed the "mind maps" as one of their favorite features in the class.

                        In the design studios, we discuss the students' ongoing work on their class projects, provide them with feedback and suggestions, connect their practice with theory, and suggest additional relevant readings and materials. The projects that the students chose to work on are either wireframes, or low-fidelity prototypes. We encouraged students to pick topics which are closely connected to their interests, and a range of fascinating projects emerged, dealing with sustainability, design thinking, music, Blockchain and learning native languages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is an example of how design studios can reinfornce a connection between the theory and practice. Two students worked on a game aimed at introducing of sustainability and design thinking concepts through a game about cooking. After reviewing their original ideas, we reminded the students how in a recent theoretical discussion, an idea from the field of game design was mentioned: "a game is a sequence of interesting choices". We encouraged them to think how it would apply to their project. We also linked their work to our readings in ethics and pointed out how portrayal of certain foods as "good" or "bad" could reinforce negative stereotypes. In the next iteration of their design, the students addressed both of these issues. They proposed a game in which the player acts as a chef. The chef needs to serve customers with different preferences: one wants to have very nutritious food, another wants to have food that is good for the planet, and so on. Different food choices are thus not portrayed as universally good or bad, but rather more or less fitting for certain purposes. And in order to simultaneously satisfy all of the customers, the chef will have to make interesting tradeoffs, all the while learning about different issues associated with food, its production, consumption and disposal of waste.

                        One thing that we strived to encourage in the class is high degree of student agency. We provided a lot of flexibility in terms of project options, so that students can choose something that fits their goals and interests well. We asked their feedback on certain decisions regarding the organization of the class. We also strived to maintain an atmosphere that would encourage conversations and sharing (partially by setting an example ourselves), rather than the conventional "lecturer-listener" dynamics. Students appreciated these efforts, and in the survey, one of them commented that they particularly liked "the free nature of the class".
